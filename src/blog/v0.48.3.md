NW v0.48.3 is released to update Node.js v14.12.0 and Chromium security patches. This should be the last version of 0.48 as 0.49 will be released soon.

Previously I released 0.48.0 with Chromium 85 upgrade, which contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Fetch Upload Streaming, WebHID API, @property** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/07/chrome-85-upload-streaming-human.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 85 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=85).

I've made the 0.48 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 85. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
