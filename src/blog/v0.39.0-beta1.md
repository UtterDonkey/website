I'm excited to announce NW.js 0.39.0-beta1 in beta branch. It ships Chromium Beta 75.

In this release the nw.* API implementation is ported to new Chromium internal components (native API bindings for extensions). The previous non-native API binding mechanism was deprecated for performance in upstream. There shouldn't be any impact on your application code. After this refactoring is done, I'll start working on another refactoring to [use native Chromium window implementation](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/5875). It's been in nightly test for a while and would become the default mode in 0.40 or 0.41.

Chromium 75 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **low latency canvas contexts, sharing files, numeric separators** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/05/chrome-75-beta-low-latency-canvas.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 75 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=75).

We've made the 0.39 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 75. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
