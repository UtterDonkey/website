Here is NW.js 0.44.3 in stable branch with Node.js v13.9.0 and Chromium security update.

Most issues blocking NW1 removal are resolved in this release. I'll wait another 1 or 2 major versions to start NW1 code removal. So it's time to remove the `--disable-features=nw2` switch from your application if you are using it. Report NW2 issues (and CC [#7230](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/7230) if it's blocking) and I'll fix them soon. 

Since 0.42.4 NW2 mode became the default. NW2 is another key step of the project with major refactoring completed for more features and better quality. Please do read more on this when you upgrade: [NW2 announcement](/blog/nw2-mode).

Previously NW 0.44 was released with Chromium 80, which contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Content Indexing, ECMAScript Modules in Web Workers, Compression Streams** and more. V8 JavaScript Engine 8.0 adds Optional chaining and reduces heap by 40% via Pointer compression. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/12/chrome-80-content-indexing-es-modules.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-80) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 80 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=80).

I've made the 0.44 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 80. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,
