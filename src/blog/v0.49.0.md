I'm excited to announce NW.js 0.49.0. It ships Chromium 86 stable upgrade.

Chromium 86 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **CSS Pseudo-Class: focus-visible and the Quick Focus Highlight, Cross-Screen Window Placement** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/09/chrome-86-improved-focus-highlighting.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 86 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=86).

I've made the 0.48 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 86. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
