I'm pleased to announce version 0.47.1, which ships latest Node.js v14.6.0. This version ships an important bug fix for `new instance` windows, where the new window is opening in an additional process. If you are using this feature, please note that the Node context is separated from the DOM context in it now. This also fixes frameworks like jQuery in the new instance window since it was confused by the mixed contexts.

Shortly ago I released NW v0.47 with Chromium 84, which contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore. It supports **Web Animations, Cookie Store API, Idle Detection, WebAssembly SIMD** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/chrome-84-beta-web-otp-web-animations.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 84 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=84).

I've made the 0.47 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 84. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
