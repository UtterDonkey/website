We're excited to announce NW.js 0.29.0-beta1 in beta branch.

Chromium 65 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports CSS Paint API, the ServerTiming API and many more. Please check [upstream information](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/02/chrome-65-beta-css-paint-api-and.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 65 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=65).

We've made the 0.29 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 65. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.
