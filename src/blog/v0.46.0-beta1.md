I'm excited to announce NW.js 0.46.0-beta1 in beta branch. It ships Chromium Beta 83.

Chromium 83 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Cross-site Scripting Protection, Improved Form Controls, WebRTC Insertable Streams and Safe Cross-origin Resource Sharing** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/04/chrome-83-beta-cross-site-scripting.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 83 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=83).

I've made the 0.46 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 83. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
