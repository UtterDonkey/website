I'm pleased to announce NW.js 0.55.0. It ships Chromium 92 stable upgrade and Node.js 16.4.2 update.

Chromium 92 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Media Session API for Video conferencing actions, Imperative Slot Distribution Behavior** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/06/chrome-92-web-apps-as-file-handlers-new.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 92 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=92).

I've made the 0.55 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 92. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
