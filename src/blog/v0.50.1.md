title: NW.js v0.50.1 Released with Node.js v15.3.0 and Widevine Support
date: 2020/11/25

# {{{title}}}
{{{date}}}

Here is the first 0.50 update with Node.js v15.3.0. Two experimental APIs [`App.enableComponent()`](https://docs.nwjs.io/en/nw50/References/App/#appenablecomponentcomponent-callback) and `App.updateComponent()` are added to enable the Widevine support in the application.

Previously I released 0.50 with Chromium 87 stable upgrade. It added supports for the **Wayland platform, Control camera pan, tilt, and zoom; CSS flow-relative shorthand and offset properties; Atomics.waitAsync(); Streams API: transferable streams** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/10/chrome-87-beta-webauthn-in-devtools.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 87 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=87).

I've made the 0.50 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 87. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
