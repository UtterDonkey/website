I'm excited to announce NW.js 0.50.0. It ships Chromium 87 stable upgrade. In this version, Wayland support is added to the Linux platform. You can add the argument `-enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland` under Wayland to enable it.

Chromium 87 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Control camera pan, tilt, and zoom; CSS flow-relative shorthand and offset properties; Atomics.waitAsync(); Streams API: transferable streams** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/10/chrome-87-beta-webauthn-in-devtools.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 87 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=87).

I've made the 0.50 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 87. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
