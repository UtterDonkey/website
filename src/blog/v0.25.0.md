We're excited to announce NW.js 0.25.0 with Chromium 61 upgrade and security updates within it.

Chromium 61 features JavaScript modules support, Payment Request API and WebUSB. See the [upstream announcement](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/08/chrome-61-beta-javascript-modules.html) for more information. The stable upgrade contains many [security fixes](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2017/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) as well.

We made the 0.25 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 61. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.
