I'm excited to announce NW.js 0.40.0-beta1 in beta branch. It ships Chromium Beta 76.

Chromium 76 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Async clipboard: read and write images, dark mode media query, JSON.parse improvements** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/06/chrome-76-beta-dark-mode-payments-new.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-76) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 76 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=76).

I've made the 0.40 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 76. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,
Roger Wang
