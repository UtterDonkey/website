NW.js 0.35.5 is released with the new NW2 mode fixes. The NW2 mode, which is the new browser window implementation, was announced in [0.35.4](https://nwjs.io/blog/v0.35.4/). It will bring more features and better quality to NW.

Previously we announced 0.35 branch which is based on up-to-date Chromium 71 engine. Chromium 71 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports International Relative Time Format, Structured cloning of Wasm modules and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/10/chrome-71-beta-relative-time-formats.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-71) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 71 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=71).

We made the 0.35 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 71. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
