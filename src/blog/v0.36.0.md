I'm excited to announce NW.js 0.36.0 stable release. It ships Chromium 72 and Node.js v11.8.0.

Chromium 72 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports Public class fields, user activation API, [screen capturing for WebRTC](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=326740), Web Authentication for U2F/CTAP2 FIDO BLE and Windows devices and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/12/chrome-72-beta-public-class-fields-user.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-72) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 72 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=72).

We made the 0.36 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumped to 72. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
