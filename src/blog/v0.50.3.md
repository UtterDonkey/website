title: NW.js v0.50.3 Released with Chromium and Node.js Update
date: 2021/01/12

# {{{title}}}
{{{date}}}

0.50.3 is released to sync up with latest Node.js v15.5.1 and Chromium 87 security update. It should be the last 0.50 release as 0.51.0 will be released with Chromium 88 soon.

Previously I released 0.50 with Chromium 87 stable upgrade. It added supports for the **Wayland platform, Control camera pan, tilt, and zoom; CSS flow-relative shorthand and offset properties; Atomics.waitAsync(); Streams API: transferable streams** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/10/chrome-87-beta-webauthn-in-devtools.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 87 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=87).

I've made the 0.50 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 87. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
