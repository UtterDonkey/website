0.37.2 is released with latest Node.js 11.13.0 and bug fixes.

Previously we announced 0.37 upgrade with Chromium 73. It contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports async stack traces, constructable stylesheets, a new RegExp function, passive mouse events and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/02/chrome-73-beta-constructable.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-73) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 73 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=73).

We've made the 0.37 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 73. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
