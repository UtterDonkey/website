I'm pleased to announce NW.js 0.56.1. It ships Node.js v16.9.1 update and Chromium 93 update.

Chromium 93 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Multi-Screen Window Placement** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/07/chrome-93-multi-screen-window-placement.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 93 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=93).

I've made the 0.56 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 93. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
