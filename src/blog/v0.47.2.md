I'm pleased to announce version 0.47.2, which ships the latest Node.js v14.7.0 and Chromium stable update. It fixes a bug in setting the window unresizable.

Shortly ago I released NW v0.47 with Chromium 84, which contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and some cool new features to explore. It supports **Web Animations, Cookie Store API, Idle Detection, WebAssembly SIMD** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/chrome-84-beta-web-otp-web-animations.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 84 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=84).

I've made the 0.47 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 84. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
