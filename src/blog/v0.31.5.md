NW.js 0.31.5 is here with Node.js 10.6.0 update, and a bug fix for macOS Mojave.

Chromium 67 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports WebXR Origin Trial, Generic Sensors and many more. Please check [upstream information](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/04/chrome-67-beta-webxr-origin-trial.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 67 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=67).

We've made the 0.31 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 67. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
