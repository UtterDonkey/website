Here is version 0.33.3 with another Chromium stable update from upstream. It contains bug fixes done in the last week as well.

Previously NW 0.33 was released with Chromium 69. It contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports [AV1 video decoder](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/08/chrome-69-media-updates#av1), new CSS tricks, OffscreenCanvas, Keyboard Map API and many more. Please check [upstream information](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/08/chrome-69-beta-av1-video-decoder-css.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 69 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=69).

We've made the 0.33 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 69. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
