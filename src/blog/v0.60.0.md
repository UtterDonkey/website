I'm pleased to announce NW.js 0.60.0. It ships Chromium 97 stable upgrade.

Chromium 97 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Auto-expand Details Elements, font-synthesis Property, WebTransport** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/11/chrome-97-webtransport-new-array-static.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 97 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=97).

I've made the 0.60 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 97. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
