This release is for Chromium 60 minor update and bug fixes. It should be the last 0.24 release as 0.25.0 will be released soon. In this version, renaming the macOS helper application is supported by [using a new field in manifest](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/For%20Users/Package%20and%20Distribute/#mac-os-x).

Chromium 60 features Paint Timing API, CSS font-display, and Credential Management API improvements. See the [upstream announcement](http://blog.chromium.org/2017/06/chrome-60-beta-paint-timing-api-css.html) for more information. You can [read the guide here](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/07/nic60) also. The stable upgrade contains many [security fixes](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2017/07/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) as well.

We made the 0.24 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 60. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
