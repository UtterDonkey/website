NW.js 0.41.2 updates only with latest Chromium 77 security update.

Previously I released 0.41.0 with Chromium 77, which contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **New Performance Metrics, New Form Capabilities, Layout Instability Monitoring** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/08/chrome-77-beta-new-performance-metrics.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-77) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 77 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=77).

I've made the 0.41 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 77. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,
Roger Wang
