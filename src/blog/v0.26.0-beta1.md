We're excited to announce NW.js 0.26.0-beta1 in beta branch.

Chromium 62 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports Network Quality Estimator API, OpenType variable fonts, and media capture from DOM elements. Please check upstream information [here](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/09/chrome-62-beta-network-quality.html)

We've made the 0.26 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 62. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
