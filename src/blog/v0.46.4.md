# {{{title}}}

This version updates Node.js to v14.5.0. As mentioned in the recent release notes, almost all the known issues blocking NW1 removal are resolved in this release. I'll wait another 1 or 2 major versions to start NW1 code removal. So it's time to remove the `--disable-features=nw2` switch from your application if you are using it. Report NW2 issues (and CC [#7230](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/7230) if it's blocking) and I'll fix them soon. 

Shortly ago I released 0.46 with Chromium 83, which supports **Cross-site Scripting Protection, Improved Form Controls, WebRTC Insertable Streams and Safe Cross-origin Resource Sharing** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/04/chrome-83-beta-cross-site-scripting.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 83 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=83).

I've made the 0.46 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 83. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
