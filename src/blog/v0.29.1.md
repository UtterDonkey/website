NW.js 0.29.1 is here with Chromium stable update, Node.js 9.8.0 and bug fixes.

Chromium 65 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports CSS Paint API, the ServerTiming API, CSS `display: contents` property and many more. Please check [upstream information](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/03/nic65) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 65 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=65).

We've made the 0.29 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 65. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
