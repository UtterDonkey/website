NW.js 0.39.3 is released with Node.js 12.6.0 and Chromium 75 security update. It also ships bug fixes.

Previously NW 0.39 was released with Chromium 75, which contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **low latency canvas contexts, sharing files, numeric separators** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/05/chrome-75-beta-low-latency-canvas.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 75 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=75).

We've made the 0.39 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 75. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,
Roger Wang
