# {{{title}}}

This release add a new field in `user-agent` field in the manifest, and fixes some crash bugs as well.

Previously we announced NW.js 0.27.0 with Chromium 63 upgrade. Chromium 63 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports Dynamic module imports, async iterators and generators and Device Memory API. Please check [upstream information](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/10/chrome-63-beta-dynamic-module-imports_27.html) for details.

In 0.27.0, we added support for loading compiled JS binary in Web Worker, options for injecting scripts into main world or isolated world of webview. A crash bug with some native modules is fixed. A bug with `--in-process-gpu` is fixed to support Steam games better.

We've made the 0.27 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 63. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
