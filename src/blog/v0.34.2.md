This version comes with Node.js v11.1.0 release and bug fixes. It fixes a few regressions as upstream is migrating to an internal `views` UI framework on macOS.

Previously we announced 0.34 with Chromium 70. It contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports shape detection, web authentication, and more. Please check [upstream information](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/09/chrome-70-beta-shape-detection-web.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 70 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=70). The V8 engine is updated with [new features](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-70) such as WebAssembly Threads and `Array.prototype.sort`.

We made the 0.34 branch ready soon after Chromium bumps to 70. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
