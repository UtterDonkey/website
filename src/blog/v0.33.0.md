I'm excited to announce a new major version 0.33.0 with Chromium 69. There are [40 security fixes](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2018/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) in this version including:

* **High CVE-2018-16065**: Out of bounds write in V8.
* **High CVE-2018-16066**: Out of bounds read in Blink.
* **High CVE-2018-16067**: Out of bounds read in WebAudio.
* **High CVE-2018-16068**: Out of bounds write in Mojo.
* **High CVE-2018-16069**: Out of bounds read in SwiftShader.
* **High CVE-2018-16070**: Integer overflow in Skia.
* **High CVE-2018-16071**: Use after free in WebRTC.

Chromium 69 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports [AV1 video decoder](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/08/chrome-69-media-updates#av1), new CSS tricks, OffscreenCanvas, Keyboard Map API and many more. Please check [upstream information](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/08/chrome-69-beta-av1-video-decoder-css.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 69 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=69).

We've made the 0.33 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 69. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
