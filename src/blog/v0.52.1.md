I'm pleased to announce NW.js 0.52.1. It ships Chromium 89 stable update and Node.js v15.12.0.

Chromium 89 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **WebHID API, Web Serial API, AVIF Image Decode** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/01/chrome-89-beta-advanced-hardware.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 89 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=89).

I've made the 0.52 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 89. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
