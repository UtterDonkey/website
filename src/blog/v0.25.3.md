Here comes another release for the Chromium 61 update, which contains important security fix regarding the V8 engine. You can see more information on this [here](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2017/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_21.html) and [here](https://v8project.blogspot.com/2017/09/disabling-escape-analysis.html).

This release includes bug fixes we've done since the last version. One of the important improvements is that the swiftshader library is shipped on both Linux and Windows. SwiftShader is a software 3D renderer used in Chrome that lets you use CSS 3D and WebGL even on hardware with incapable GPUs. So you can provide advanced 3D graphics independent from hardware of your users.

Last week we announced NW.js 0.25 with Chromium 61 upgrade. Chromium 61 features JavaScript modules support, Payment Request API and WebUSB. See the [upstream announcement](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/08/chrome-61-beta-javascript-modules.html) for more information. The stable upgrade contains many [security fixes](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2017/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) as well.

We made the 0.25 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 61. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.
