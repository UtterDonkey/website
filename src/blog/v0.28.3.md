This is a release to update Chromium and Node.js 9.6.1. And it should be the last 0.28 release as Chromium upstream will release M65 soon. If you are new to 0.28 release, please read the [0.28.0 release notes](https://nwjs.io/blog/v0.28.0/) as well.

Chromium 64 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports Resize Observer, import meta and many more. Please check [upstream information](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/01/nic64) for details, as well as the [Chrome status page](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone%3D64).

We've made the 0.28 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 64. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.
