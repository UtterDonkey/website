I'm pleased to announce NW.js 0.59.0. It ships Chromium 96 stable upgrade and Node.js v17.1.0. Starting from this release, the major version will be upgraded with Chromium upstream every 4 weeks as Chromium stable moved to a [faster release cycle](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/process/release_cycle.md) from 6 weeks. This ensures the NW.js programmers the access to the latest features and security updates from upstream.

Chromium 96 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Back-forward cache, :autofill Pseudo Class** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/10/chrome-96-beta-conditional-focus.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 96 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=96).

I've made the 0.59 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 96. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
