I'm pleased to announce NW.js 0.58.0. It ships Chromium 95 stable upgrade. Starting from this release, the major version will be upgraded with Chromium upstream every 4 weeks as Chromium stable moved to a [faster release cycle](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/docs/process/release_cycle.md) from 6 weeks. This ensures the NW.js programmers the access to the latest features and security updates from upstream.

Chromium 95 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **WebAssembly Exception Handling, EyeDropper API, URLPattern** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/09/chrome-95-beta-secure-payment.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 95 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=95).

I've made the 0.58 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 95. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
