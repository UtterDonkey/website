The NW.js team is excited to announce NW.js 0.33.0-beta1 in beta branch.

Chromium 69 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports [AV1 video decoder](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/08/chrome-69-media-updates#av1), new CSS tricks, OffscreenCanvas, Keyboard Map API and many more. Please check [upstream information](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/08/chrome-69-beta-av1-video-decoder-css.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 69 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=69).

We've made the 0.33 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 69. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

[An issue on macOS transparency](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/6750) was reported specifically for 0.33. It will be fixed later.
