Here is NW.js 0.42.5 with Chromium security update and various NW2 mode fixes.

In previous version NW2 mode became the default. NW2 is another key step of the project with major refactoring completed for more features and better quality. See more information on [NW2 announcement here](/blog/nw2-mode).

Previously I released NW.js 0.42 major version with Chromium 78, which contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, and there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Custom CSS Properties, SMS Receiver API, Faster Web Sockets** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/09/chrome-78-beta-new-houdini-api-native.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-78) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 78 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=78).

I've made the 0.42 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 78. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,
