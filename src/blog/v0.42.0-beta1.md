I'm excited to announce NW.js 0.42.0-beta1 in beta branch. It ships Chromium Beta 78.

Chromium 78 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Custom CSS Properties, SMS Receiver API, Faster Web Sockets** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/09/chrome-78-beta-new-houdini-api-native.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-78) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 78 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=78).

I've made the 0.42 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 78. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,
Roger Wang
