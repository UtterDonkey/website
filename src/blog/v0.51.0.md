I'm pleased to announce NW.js 0.51.0. It ships Chromium 88 stable upgrade.

Chromium 88 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **The aspect-ratio CSS property, Disable mouse acceleration with the Pointer Lock API** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-chrome-88/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 88 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=88).

I've made the 0.51 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 88. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
