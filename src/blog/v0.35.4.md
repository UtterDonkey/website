NW.js 0.35.4 is released with Node.js v11.6.0.

The new browser window implementation, which is an important refactoring I've been working on, gets an early testing release under `--enable-features=nw2` switch. This work will be the foundation to enable more major features (tab support, find in page etc) and fix important issues. It moves NW application window implementation from Chrome App window to Chromium browser window.

Please help testing it by adding the switch to the command line or [`chromium-args` in manifest](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/References/Manifest%20Format/#chromium-args). Your application should work in the same way without any change. But this is still a feature in early phase development, please expect bugs and report them under [#5875](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/5875). The plan is to make the switch default after 2-3 major releases and then start to remove the old implementation later. This refactoring is not as big as what's done in 0.13, but it's the most exciting change since then.

Chromium 71 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports International Relative Time Format, Structured cloning of Wasm modules and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/10/chrome-71-beta-relative-time-formats.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-71) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 71 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=71).

We made the 0.35 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 71. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
