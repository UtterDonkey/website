NW.js 0.30.5 is released to sync with Chromium update. It also contains bug fixes and upstream PaymentRequest API support.

Previously we announced NW.js 0.30.0 stable with Chromium 66 upgrade. There are [62 security fixes](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2018/04/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) in that version.

Chromium 66 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports ImageBitmap Rendering Context for canvas, CSS Typed Object Model, Async Clipboard API, AudioWorklet and many more. Please check [upstream information](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/04/nic66) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 66 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=66).

We've made the 0.30 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 66. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
