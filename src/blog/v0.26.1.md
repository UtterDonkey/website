This is a release for the Node.js security update as well as the bug fixes.

Last week we announced NW.js 0.26 with Chromium 62 upgrade. It supports Network Quality Estimator API, OpenType variable fonts, and media capture from DOM elements. Please check upstream information [here](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/10/nic62). The stable upgrade contains many [security fixes](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2017/10/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) as well.

We made the 0.26 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 62. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.
