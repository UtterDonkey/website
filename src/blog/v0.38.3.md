Here comes another version to update with latest Node.js v12.2.0 and security update in Chromium 74 stable. Upstream updates very often as I'm preparing the upcoming 0.39.0 beta release.

Previously 0.38 was released with Chromium 74, which contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Private class fields, CSS prefers-reduced-motion media query, JavaScript API for feature policy** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/03/chrome-74-beta-reducing-unwanted-motion.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-74) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 74 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=74).

We've made the 0.38 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 74. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,
