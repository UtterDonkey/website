# {{{title}}}

This is a release for the Node.js 8.6.0 security update only.

Earlier this month we announced NW.js 0.25 with Chromium 61 upgrade. Chromium 61 features JavaScript modules support, Payment Request API and WebUSB. See the [upstream announcement](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/08/chrome-61-beta-javascript-modules.html) for more information. The stable upgrade contains many [security fixes](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2017/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html) as well.

We made the 0.25 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 61. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.
