I'm excited to announce NW.js 0.46.0 which ships Chromium 83 stable upgrade. Chromium 83 ships many features, security updates and performance improvements than usual because version 82 was skipped.

It supports **Cross-site Scripting Protection, Improved Form Controls, WebRTC Insertable Streams and Safe Cross-origin Resource Sharing** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/04/chrome-83-beta-cross-site-scripting.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 83 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=83).

I've made the 0.46 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 83. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
