NW.js 0.35.3 is released with Node.js v11.5.0. Now it supports loading application pages in offscreen tab. Progress has been made for the internal refactoring about Window features. Once it's done, more features will enabled on top of it like native find and native tabs. You can watch [#5875](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/issues/5875) for progress and announcements.

Chromium 71 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports International Relative Time Format, Structured cloning of Wasm modules and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/10/chrome-71-beta-relative-time-formats.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-71) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 71 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=71).

We made the 0.35 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 71. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
