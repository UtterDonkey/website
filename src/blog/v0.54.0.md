I'm pleased to announce NW.js 0.54.0. It ships Chromium 90 stable upgrade.

Chromium 91 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **WebTransport, WebXR Plane Detection API** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/04/chrome-91-handwriting-recognition-webxr.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 91 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=91).

I've made the 0.54 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 91. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
