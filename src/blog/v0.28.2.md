0.28.2 is here with Chromium 64 update with important security fix. If you are new to 0.28 release, please read the [0.28.0 release notes](https://nwjs.io/blog/v0.28.0/) as well.

Chromium 64 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports Resize Observer, import meta and many more. Please check [upstream information](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/01/nic64) for details, as well as the [Chrome status page](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone%3D64).

We've made the 0.28 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 64. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.
