NW.js 0.32.1 is here with Node.js v10.8.0 and Chromium 68 stable update.

Chromium 68 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports payment handler API, page lifecycle API, High resolution timestamp for Gamepad and many more. Please check [upstream information](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/nic68) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 68 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=68).

We've made the 0.32 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 68. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
