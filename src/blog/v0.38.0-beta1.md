I'm excited to announce NW.js 0.38.0-beta1 in beta branch. It ships Chromium Beta 74.

Chromium 74 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Private class fields, CSS prefers-reduced-motion media query, JavaScript API for feature policy** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/03/chrome-74-beta-reducing-unwanted-motion.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-74) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 74 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=74).

We've made the 0.38 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 74. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
