We're excited to announce NW.js 0.28.0-beta1 in beta branch.

Chromium 64 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports Resize Observer, import meta and many more. Please check [upstream information](http://blog.chromium.org/2017/12/chrome-64-beta-stronger-pop-up-blocker_14.html) for details.

We've made the 0.28 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 64. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. We've been working on 3 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable, a beta branch on Chromium beta and a 0.14 branch for legacy OS support.

For more information on the new milestone 0.13 and later versions, please see [our blog "What's New in 0.13"](/blog/whats-new-in-0.13) for a better introduction.
