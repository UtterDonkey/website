0.37.4 is released to sync up with latest Node.js v11.14.0. It ships several bug fixes. This should be the last release of 0.37 branch as 0.38.0 will be released soon with Chromium 74 stable upgrade.

Previously we announced 0.37 upgrade with Chromium 73. It contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports async stack traces, constructable stylesheets, a new RegExp function, passive mouse events and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/02/chrome-73-beta-constructable.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-73) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 73 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=73).

We've made the 0.37 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 73. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Thanks and best regards,  
Roger Wang
