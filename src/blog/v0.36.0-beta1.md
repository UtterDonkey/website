I'm excited to announce NW.js 0.36.0-beta1 in beta branch. It ships Chromium Beta 72 and Node.js v11.5.0.

Chromium 72 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports Public class fields, user activation and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/12/chrome-72-beta-public-class-fields-user.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-72) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 72 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=72).

We've made the 0.36 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 72. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
