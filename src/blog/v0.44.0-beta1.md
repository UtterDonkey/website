I'm excited to announce NW.js 0.44.0-beta1 in beta branch. It ships Chromium Beta 80.

Chromium 80 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Content Indexing, ECMAScript Modules in Web Workers, Compression Streams** and more. V8 JavaScript Engine 8.0 adds Optional chaining and reduces heap by 40% via Pointer compression. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/12/chrome-80-content-indexing-es-modules.html) and [v8 blog](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-80) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 80 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=80).

I've made the 0.44 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 80. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,
Roger Wang
