title: NW.js v0.45.3 Released with Chromium Security Update

# {{{title}}}

NW.js 0.45.3 ships latest Chromium stable 81, which has a critical security update on the speech recognition feature.

Shortly ago I released 0.45 with Chromium 81, which contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Augmented Reality and Hit Testing, PointerLock unadjustedMovement, Modernized Form Controls** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/02/chrome-81-near-field-communications.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 81 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=81).

I made the 0.45 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 81. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
