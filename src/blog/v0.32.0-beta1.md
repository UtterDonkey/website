The NW.js team is excited to announce NW.js 0.32.0-beta1 in beta branch.

Chromium 68 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports payment handler API, page lifecycle API, High resolution timestamp for Gamepad and many more. Please check [upstream information](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/06/chrome-68-beta-add-to-home-screen.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 68 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=68).

We've made the 0.32 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 68. Please try it and give your valuable feedback. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
