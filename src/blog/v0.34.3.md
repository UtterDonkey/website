# {{{title}}}
{{{date}}}

This version syncs up with Chromium [70.0.3538.102](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2018/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html), which fixed a security bug: CVE-2018-17478: Out of bounds memory access in V8. It also supports NW security model with cross origin iframes. See the changelog for detail.

Previously we announced 0.34 with Chromium 70. It contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports shape detection, web authentication, and more. Please check [upstream information](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/09/chrome-70-beta-shape-detection-web.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 70 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=70). The V8 engine is updated with [new features](https://v8.dev/blog/v8-release-70) such as WebAssembly Threads and `Array.prototype.sort`.

We made the 0.34 branch ready soon after Chromium bumps to 70. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. We've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.
